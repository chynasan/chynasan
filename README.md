Hi, I’m Chyna! My background is in Windows system administration and VMware administration and engineering. I wrote training courses for Red Hat, and now work on Ansible.

Outside of work, I’m interested in philosophy, traveling, music, art, cooking, and video games. 

You can reach me at my personal address chynaesan@gmail.com.
