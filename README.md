Hi, I’m Chyna! My background is in Windows systems administration, and VMware administration and engineering. I have recently started writing curriculum for Red Hat.

Outside of work, I’m interested in art, traveling, language learning, cooking, and video games. 

You can reach me at my personal address chynaesan@gmail.com.
